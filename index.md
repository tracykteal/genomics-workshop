Data Carpentry workshops are for any researcher who has data they want to analyze , and no prior computational experience is required. This hands-on workshop teaches basic concepts, skills and tools for working more effectively with data.

The focus of this workshop will be on working with genomics data and data management and analysis for genomics research. We will cover metadata organization in spreadsheets, data organization, connecting to and using cloud computing, the command line for sequence quality control and bioinformatics workflows, and R for data analysis and visualization. We will not be teaching any particular bioinformatics tools, but the foundational skills that will allow you to conduct any analysis and analyze the output of a genomics pipeline.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> There are no pre-requisites, and the materials assume no prior knowledge about the tools. Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively.

### Amazon instance for workshop

All the software and data used in the workshop is on an Amazon AMI.

If you want to run your instance of the server used for this workshop, launch a t2.medium instance with AMI in the **N. Virginia** region **ami-aab445c7**, available under "Community AMIs" in the Amazon EC2 Management Console. 

[Information on how to launch an instance](https://github.com/datacarpentry/cloud-genomics/blob/gh-pages/lessons/1.logging-onto-cloud.md)

### Requirements

Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
their own computers to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workfl\
ow.
*These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the skills or tools*, but working
through this lesson requires working copies of the software described.
To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to install everything
*before* working through this workshop.
